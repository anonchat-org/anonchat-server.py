    <h3>
        <span class="green">anonchat</span> - a microprotocol for communication built using TCP sockets.</br>
    </h3>

    <p>
        A server acts as a message distributor between the connected clients, while a client can send and recieve
        messages.
    </p>

    <p>
        A typical anonchat message is just a JSON encoded object which contains message text and (optionally) its
        author. The socket has only one event: an incoming message. The protocol is simple as hell. It's very easy to
        configure, extend and hack.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example message object:
        <span class="green">{"user": "calamity", "msg": "hey, how you doing today?"}</span></br>
        Pretty simple, isn't it?
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, there is a client and server protocol implementations written on various languages, like Dart, Python,
        Rust, etc. You can see the source codes <a href="https://github.com/anonchat-org" class="green">here</a>.
